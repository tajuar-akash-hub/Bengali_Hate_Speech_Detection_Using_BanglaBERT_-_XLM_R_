# Questions and Answers from BanglaBERT

## 1. What is `normalizer`?
The `normalizer` is a utility library designed for text normalization, particularly for Bengali language text. It cleans and standardizes text by:
- Removing unnecessary characters or symbols.
- Correcting formatting issues like multiple spaces.
- Making the text consistent for processing by machine learning models.

In the context of BanglaBERT, the `normalizer` ensures that the input text is properly formatted and free of extraneous characters, which helps improve the accuracy of tokenization and model predictions.

## 2. What is a `caretaking wheel`?
This term does not directly apply to the BanglaBERT implementation. If you intended to ask about a related feature or concept, please clarify the question. It might be a typo or a phrase with a specific meaning in another context.

## 3. Why is `tokenization` important?
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, like words, subwords, or characters. In the context of BanglaBERT:
- **Purpose**: Converts raw text into a format that the model understands.
- **Importance**:
  - Handles out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them into subwords.
  - Ensures consistent input size for the model by padding or truncating.
  - Prepares text for embedding into a numerical format.

BanglaBERT uses a tokenizer specific to its pretrained vocabulary, ensuring that the input aligns with what the model was trained on.

## 4. What is `weight decay` in the trainer function?
Weight decay is a regularization technique used during training to prevent overfitting. It:
- Adds a penalty to the loss function based on the magnitude of the model weights.
- Encourages smaller weights, which helps reduce model complexity.
- Is implemented via the `AdamW` optimizer in the trainer.

In BanglaBERT, weight decay helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

---

## 5. What is a `utility function`?
A utility function is a helper function that performs specific tasks to support the main operations of a program. In BanglaBERT, utility functions include:
- Loading and preprocessing data.
- Tokenizing text.
- Computing evaluation metrics.
- Handling file saving and loading.

These functions simplify the codebase and make it more modular and maintainable.

---

## 6. What is a `checkpoint`?
A checkpoint is a saved state of the model during training. It includes:
- Model weights and biases.
- Optimizer state.
- Learning rate scheduler state.

Checkpoints allow:
- Resuming training from a specific point.
- Restoring the best-performing model after training.

---

## 7. What is `early stopping`?
Early stopping is a training technique where training is halted if the model's performance on the validation set stops improving after a certain number of epochs. Benefits include:
- Preventing overfitting.
- Saving computational resources.

---

## 8. What is a `checkpoint 20, 30`?
These likely refer to checkpoints saved at specific epochs, such as the 20th or 30th epoch during training. They capture the model's state at that point, allowing you to analyze or resume training from those specific epochs.

---

## 9. What is `tokenizer_config.json`?
This file contains configuration details for the tokenizer, such as:
- Tokenizer type (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece).
- Vocabulary size.
- Special tokens (e.g., `[PAD]`, `[CLS]`).

---

## 10. What is `config.json`?
This file stores the configuration for the pretrained model, including:
- Model architecture (e.g., number of layers, hidden units).
- Hyperparameters used during training.
- Metadata about the model.

---

## 11. What is `sentencepiece.bpe.model`?
This file is a model for the SentencePiece tokenizer, which implements Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE). It contains:
- Vocabulary and subword units.
- Rules for tokenizing text into subwords.

---

## 12. What is `tokenizer.json`?
This file is an alternative to `tokenizer_config.json` and includes:
- Full details about the tokenizer.
- Token-to-ID mapping.
- Rules for encoding and decoding text.

---

## 13. What is `model.safetensors`?
This file stores the trained model's weights in a safe and efficient format. Compared to the traditional `.bin` format, it:
- Is faster to load.
- Provides better compatibility with distributed systems.
- Ensures safe weight storage with reduced risk of corruption.
