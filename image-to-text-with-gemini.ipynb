The first task is to **extract everything** from the image, including all dialogue parts. If the image already contains a **caption** or **character labels** (like **[Me]**, **[He]**, etc.), **do not reassign or override** the existing labels. If the labels are already present in the text, **keep them as they are**.\n\n**Important:** **Do not translate the text.** If the text is in **Bengali** or any other language, **keep it in the original language**. Do not translate the text into English or any other language.\n\nAfter the text is extracted:\n1. **Categorize the dialogue** by identifying who is speaking in the image, only for parts that do not already have a character label. For example:\n   - If the text is spoken by the **father**, label it as **[father]**.\n   - If the text is spoken by the **son**, label it as **[son]**.\n   - If the dialogue is between a **boyfriend** and **girlfriend**, label the parts as **[boyfriend]** and **[girlfriend]**.\n\n2. If there are multiple characters speaking in sequence, maintain the **correct order**. For example, if **Girlfriend** speaks first and **Boyfriend** responds, output them in that order.\n3. **Do not repeat** the dialogue for any character. Each part should be uniquely attributed to one character.\n4. If the model is unable to categorize the character, label the dialogue as **[caption]** instead of any character. For example, if there is no clear character to attribute, output the text as **[caption]** followed by the extracted text.\n5. Only output the dialogue in the following format:\n   - **[character]: [text]**\n   - If the label already exists in the image, **do not modify** it.\n6. **Avoid including any social media handles** if present in the image.\n7. The model should base its categorization on **visual context** and **dialogue cues** from the image.\n\nExample:\nIf the image contains a conversation like:\n- [Me]: \"Hey, what's up?\"\n- [He]: \"Not much, you?\"\n- [Me]: \"Just chilling!\"\n- [He]: \"Cool!\"\n\nThe output should be:\n[Me]: Hey, what's up?\n[He]: Not much, you?\n[Me]: Just chilling!\n[He]: Cool!\n\nIf the model cannot categorize the character, it should label the dialogue as **[caption]**:\n[caption]: \"This is an ambiguous part of the text with no clear character.\"\n\nMake sure the output only contains **dialogue** in the specified format, with **no preamble or explanation**.\n\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Generate image to text","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport time\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Step 4: Function to process the first 700 images and generate text with a sleep mechanism\ndef process_images_from_folder(folder_path, model, prompt, max_images, sleep_time=20):\n    #

The first task is to **extract everything** from the image, including all dialogue parts. If the image already contains a **caption** or **character labels** (like **[Me]**, **[He]**, etc.), **do not reassign or override** the existing labels. If the labels are already present in the text, **keep them as they are**.\n\n**Important:** **Do not translate the text.** If the text is in **Bengali** or any other language, **keep it in the original language**. Do not translate the text into English or any other language.\n\nAfter the text is extracted:\n1. **Categorize the dialogue** by identifying who is speaking in the image, only for parts that do not already have a character label. For example:\n   - If the text is spoken by the **father**, label it as **[father]**.\n   - If the text is spoken by the **son**, label it as **[son]**.\n   - If the dialogue is between a **boyfriend** and **girlfriend**, label the parts as **[boyfriend]** and **[girlfriend]**.\n\n2. If there are multiple characters speaking in sequence, maintain the **correct order**. For example, if **Girlfriend** speaks first and **Boyfriend** responds, output them in that order.\n3. **Do not repeat** the dialogue for any character. Each part should be uniquely attributed to one character.\n4. If the model is unable to categorize the character, label the dialogue as **[caption]** instead of any character. For example, if there is no clear character to attribute, output the text as **[caption]** followed by the extracted text.\n5. Only output the dialogue in the following format:\n   - **[character]: [text]**\n   - If the label already exists in the image, **do not modify** it.\n6. **Avoid including any social media handles** if present in the image.\n7. The model should base its categorization on **visual context** and **dialogue cues** from the image.\n\nExample:\nIf the image contains a conversation like:\n- [Me]: \"Hey, what's up?\"\n- [He]: \"Not much, you?\"\n- [Me]: \"Just chilling!\"\n- [He]: \"Cool!\"\n\nThe output should be:\n[Me]: Hey, what's up?\n[He]: Not much, you?\n[Me]: Just chilling!\n[He]: Cool!\n\nIf the model cannot categorize the character, it should label the dialogue as **[caption]**:\n[caption]: \"This is an ambiguous part of the text with no clear character.\"\n\nMake sure the output only contains **dialogue** in the specified format, with **no preamble or explanation**.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n\ndef process_images_from_folder(folder_path, client, prompt, start_image, end_image, sleep_time=5):\n    # Available Gemini models in order of preference\n    available_models = [\n        \"gemini-2.5-pro\",\n        \"gemini-2.5-flash\", \n        \"gemini-1.5-pro\",\n        \"gemini-1.5-flash\",\n        \"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\", \n        \"gemini-2.5-flash-preview\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Track which models have hit their limits\n    exhausted_models = set()\n    \n    # Check if sorted image list already exists (saved previously)\n    sorted_images_file = '/kaggle/working/sorted_image_list.txt'\n    \n    # If sorted list doesn't exist, sort the images and save the list\n    if not os.path.exists(sorted_images_file):\n        # List all image files in the folder\n        image_files = [f for f in os.listdir(folder_path) if f.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'))]\n        \n        # Sort the files numerically by the number in the filename\n        image_files.sort(key=lambda x: int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit, x))))\n        \n        # Save the sorted image list to a file\n        with open(sorted_images_file, 'w') as f:\n            for image in image_files:\n                f.write(image + '\\n')\n        \n        print(f\"Sorted image list saved to {sorted_images_file}.\")\n    else:\n        # If sorted list file exists, read the image list from the file\n        with open(sorted_images_file, 'r') as f:\n            image_files = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]\n        \n        print(f\"Loaded sorted image list from {sorted_images_file}.\")\n    \n    # Select the images based on the given range\n    images_to_process = image_files[start_image-1:end_image]  # 0-based indexing adjustment\n    \n    # Initialize CSV file path\n    output_csv_path = f\"/kaggle/working/{start_image}_to_{end_image}_memes_text.csv\"\n    \n    # Create CSV header if file doesn't exist\n    if not os.path.exists(output_csv_path):\n        df_header = pd.DataFrame(columns=[\"image_name\", \"comment\", \"Hate\"])\n        df_header.to_csv(output_csv_path, index=False)\n    \n    # Initialize current index\n    current_index = start_image\n    \n    def is_rate_limit_error(error_message):\n        \"\"\"Check if error is related to rate limiting\"\"\"\n        rate_limit_indicators = [\n            \"rate limit\", \"quota\", \"too many requests\", \"limit exceeded\",\n            \"429\", \"resource exhausted\", \"requests per minute\", \"requests per day\"\n        ]\n        error_str = str(error_message).lower()\n        return any(indicator in error_str for indicator in rate_limit_indicators)\n    \n    def try_with_model(model_name, img, prompt):\n        \"\"\"Try to generate content with a specific model\"\"\"\n        try:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=model_name, \n                contents=[img, prompt]\n            )\n            return response.text, None\n        except Exception as e:\n            return None, str(e)\n    \n    # Loop through the images and process them\n    for image_name in images_to_process:\n        image_path = os.path.join(folder_path, image_name)\n        \n        try:\n            img = Image.open(image_path)\n            \n            # Try each available model until one works or all are exhausted\n            success = False\n            result_text = None\n            \n            for model in available_models:\n                if model in exhausted_models:\n                    continue  # Skip models that have hit their limits\n                \n                print(f\"Trying model: {model} for image {current_index}\")\n                \n                result_text, error = try_with_model(model, img, prompt)\n                \n                if result_text is not None:\n                    # Success!
